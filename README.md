# Telecom Churn Prediction

Telecom Churn Prediction using machine learning classifiers Random Forest,KNN, SVC, XGBoost, and ANN are used to predict potential churners.

To see the impact of feature selection and hyperparamter tuning, Prediction is carried out using specified classifiers applying Hyperparameter tuning using GridsearchCV method once before doing feature selection and again applying feature selection using embedded method.

To refer to code without feature selection refer to file Telecomchurn_beforefeaturesel.ipynb or Telecomchurn_beforefeaturesel.py 
To refer to code with feature selection applied using embedded method refer to file Telecomchurn_afterfeatureselection.ipynb or Telecomchurn_afterfeatureselection.py 
Dataset used for the prediction is in WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv file
